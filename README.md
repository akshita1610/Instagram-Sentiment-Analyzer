## Instagram Sentiment Analyzer

Created by **Akshita Malayathi** - This is my NLP (Natural Language Processing) project for analyzing the sentiment of Instagram posts. It provides valuable insights into the positivity and negativity of comments on a given post URL, stores information in PostgreSQL server, and visualizes results with Power BI.


### Overview

My Instagram Sentiment Analyzer is designed to seamlessly analyze sentiment through a user-friendly web interface. It employs a combination of web scraping, NLP techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to deliver comprehensive sentiment analysis results.

### Features

- **Web Application**: Users can input the URL of an Instagram post through a web interface.


- **FastAPI Server Integration**: The web app communicates with a FastAPI server for efficient data processing.


- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Scrapy for extracting comments from Instagram posts.



- **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs NLTK for NLP tasks, including tokenization and sentiment analysis.


- **Machine Learning**: Develops a sentiment prediction model using various machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Storage**: Stores comments and sentiment data in PostgreSQL for future analysis.

- **Power BI Dashboard**: Visualizes sentiment insights through a Power BI report for easy interpretation.
### Achievements

- Streamlined sentiment analysis of Instagram posts with an intuitive web interface.
- Leveraged NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms for accurate sentiment prediction.
- Provided users with comprehensive sentiment insights, including post-level positivity and negativity percentages.
